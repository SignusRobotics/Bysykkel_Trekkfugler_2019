# Bysykkel_Trekkfugler_2019
In this project our hypothesis is that a large part of the distribution problem Osly Bysykkel is experiencing can be solved or alleviated by introducing the concept of "Trekkfugler" / migratory birds. We will try to verify this hypothesis by analyzing public data from Oslo Bysykkel and the Norwegian Meteorological Institute.
